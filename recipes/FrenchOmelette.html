        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The French Omelette is one of the most delicious ways to cook eggs, it's soft in the outside and creamy in the inside.
           It's like the combination of an omelette and scrambled eggs.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Three eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation list</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack three eggs into a bowl</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs until they create bubbles and are fully mixed</li>
            <li>Prepare a pan at medium-low heat and add a cube of butter to it</li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the pan and start stiring violently so the eggs start to jell like scrambled eggs</li>
            <li>When the surface of the omelette is wet but not raw, add salt and/or pepper and start flipping it like a roller, the idea is to create a tube</li>
            <li>Plate it adding a little bit of butter to its surface so it generates glow, add parsley and you're ready to go!</li>
        </ol>
